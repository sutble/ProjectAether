# Project Earthshaker

Project Earthshaker is a VR Game that simulates environment manipulation through gestures. The user can summon rocks and boulders from the ground, and punch them at incoming archers. They can also raise pillars for blocking arrows, and if they are feeling particularly defensive, raise a wall. It is a wave based game, with more archers coming on each level. There are plans to add multiplayer functionality in the future. 

This project has gained a lot of interest on the internet, gaining over 50,000 views in the first week. We also demoed the game at PAX West to about 200 people.
